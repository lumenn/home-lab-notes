# Setting Git for corporate use case with SSL and SSH keys.
1. Set global http sslCAInfo for internal git, this way both public git services and private will work without throwing *SSL certificate problem: unable to  get local issuer certificate*: `git config --global http."https://code.example.com/".sslCAInfo <downloaded certificate>.pem` (you can download certificate through browser).`
2. Generate ssh key using ssh-keygen like this: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "comment"`. Add the key on your git hosting. You can use `pagent` with `schannel` backend, or `openssl` backend with `ssh-agent`. I'm personally storing my ssh keys inside KeepassXC, which adds them automatically to pagent/ssh-agent on database unlock.
