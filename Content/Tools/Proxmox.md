This a bare metal hypervisor - in simple terms, it's an OS, in which you can deploy VM's, and this is the main purpose of that OS. It's also an alternative to [VMware ESXi/vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html). 

I'm using it to keep multiple different OS running on single server. In my case Linux/Windows.


### First time setup

As far as i know - first VM, from which there will be an template created needs to be initiated manually.
